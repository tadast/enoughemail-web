## Case studies

### Worried CTO

Ash, who's a CTO at a London based startup, has recently lost her best engineer Drew. At an exit interview Drew told Ash that a recruiter had invited him for a coffee via work email. This has eventually lead Drew to a new career opportunity. Ash was upset to find out that it was the same recruiter who had emailed her weeks ago to offer interviews with other available engineers. Her company does not work with external recruiters. Ash has applied an "Unethical UK Recruiters" filter from Enough Email to protect her entire organization from similar situations in future.

### Overwhelmed Executive assistant

Rory is an executive assitant to three c-level executives. She's screening their email to ensure only relevant correspondence reaches them. Due to the recent press release about a new funding round, all executive email accounts are flooded with unsolicited cold sales emails. Cold sellers follow up twice on average. Rory uses Enough Email to effortlessly block intrusive sender domains and is at peace knowing their consecutive emails will not reach any of the executive inboxes in future.


### Startup who cares

Kyle works for a small, globally distributed SaaS that sells integrations between different services. The company uses email for async communication with their clients. Due to the nature of work, they also need to sign up to a lot of SaaS products that they write integrations for, which inevitably leads to an avalanche of newsletters. Some of them are very hard to unsubscribe from. Kyle and her colleagues use Enough Email to filter such correspondence. They love it, because it's easier than unsubscribing, and one person's effort benefits everyone. They also feel at ease knowing that their Enough Email filters only skip the inbox and prevent notifications, but all filtered email can still be found if needed.
